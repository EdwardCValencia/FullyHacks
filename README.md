# Preface
You are a spacefarer who has come across a strange alien during your journey. 
It wishes to speak with you, but your communicator's battery is low and
it doesn't know a lot of words.It is up to you do decide what to do with them.

# Instructions
To speak with the alien, type whatever you want into the text box and hit enter.

To teach the alien a word, type "teach \<word\>" and hit enter.

These actions decrease your battery every time you do them, so be careful not to overdo it.
If you run out of battery, you won't be able to speak to the alien anymore.

At the end of the game, you must decide if the alien is a friend or a foe.
Hopefully, you'll make the right call.

# sv

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npx sv create

# create a new project in my-app
npx sv create my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
